# hype package

The hype package contains various functions for critical value, power, minimum detectable effect, minimum required sample and confidednce interval calculations in the context of proportions difference hypothesis testing.

The package repo also contains an [excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/IyarLin/hype/blob/master/inst/calculators.xlsx) implementing all the functions. This can be especially useful for users without knowledge of R.

Simple derivations of the functions in the package can be found in this [document](https://github.com/IyarLin/hype/blob/master/inst/variuos_results_for_hypothesis_testing.pdf)
